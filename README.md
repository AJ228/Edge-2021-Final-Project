# Game of Chance: Race Against Luck

## Edge 2021 Final Project - Adithya

A turn-based game you play against a computer based on luck.

Use rock-paper-scissors to decide who goes first in each turn.

Race against the computer to be the first to gain/exceed 100 points!

Progress through the game by choosing between 3 point brackets:
1) Safe play: Yields the lowest points but cannot lose any points
2) Feeling lucky: More points can be gained (at lower rates) but points can also be lost
3) Go big or go home: Most points can be gained from here (with VERY low rates) and also have the highest chance to lose points too (can lose a lot if you are unlucky)

### *How you perform could also determine if you gain a place in the "Special Wall" (so try to find ways to stand out in your games)

## Have fun!
